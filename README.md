#### This project was aimed at scraping the public badge profiles of the Google Cloud Study Jam participants. This data can then be used in any project through a MongoDB database. This is especially helpful for creating a leaderboard for the program.

## How to use

- Clone the repository in your desired directory
- Store one of your daily report csv file in the `./src/data` directory _<br>(Don't worry, you only need to do this once, this is required to fetch the public badge profile URLs)_
